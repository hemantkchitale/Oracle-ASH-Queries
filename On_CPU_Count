REM Get the number of Sessions which are not in a Wait State but actually on CPU, as reported by Oracle ASH.
REM Note that DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY maintains only 1 in 10 snapshots captured by V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY 
REM so this is not as accurate as the V$ view but does go back 60 days (unlike the V$ view which may go back only a few hours or a couple of days).

from dba_hist_active_sess_history h, dba_hist_snapshot s
where h.snap_id=s.snap_id
and h.dbid=s.dbid
and s.dbid=(select dbid  from v$database)
and h.session_State = 'ON CPU'
and s.begin_interval_time >  sysdate-60
group by h.sample_time
order by 1
